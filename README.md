# flight_trajectory_calculator
A Python-based application that simulates the motion of a projectile launched into the air. It calculates and captures the trajectory of the projectile on a cartesian plane for visualization. The trajectory is based on parameters such as initial speed, launch angle, and initial height. The project incorporates fundamental physics concepts from University Physics I, including projectile motion and gravitational effects. Users can simulate the same experience on other planets and even the moon.  Currently enhancing features such as advanced trajectory analysis and user interface improvements. 

Looking forward to making the program more robust to tackle multiple problems involving projectile motion.
